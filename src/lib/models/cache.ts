 * 
 * ## Cache
 * 
 * ### Introduction
 * 
 * The Cache class can be used by the modules realizing heavy computations
 * to reuse some results that can not have changed from one run to another.
 * 
 * This scenario is actually quite common, and the immutable nature 
 * of the data produced by the modules makes it easy to manage (and safe ðŸ˜·).
 * 
 * Here is an hypothetical scenario illustrating the discussion:
 * ```
 *             physicalMdle 
 *                          \
 *                           combineMdle-->simulatorMdle-->viewerMdle
 *                          /
 *  sliderMdle-->solverMdle
 * ```
 * 
 * In the above workflow:
 * -    the central module is the **simulatorMdle**, it takes a *physicalModel* and a *solverModel* as input 
 * to realize a simulation. To actually do the simulation, it computes an intermediate result relying
 * only on the *physicalModel*, this computation is actually the bottleneck in terms of performance -
 * e.g. it can take a couple of seconds.
 * -    the **solverMdle** returns a *solverModel*, it somehow relies on the value of some parameters
 * provided by a **sliderMdle** (the user is expected to aggressively move from left to right ðŸ˜ˆ).
 * -    the **physicalMdle** emit a *physicalModel*, it has been tuned at 'building time' (there is only
 * one version of it emitted as it is not connected to some inputs)
 * -    the **combineMdle** emit a new message [*solverModel*, *physicalModel*] with their latest 
 * version available each time one of its input receive a new value (in this case it will always be
 * from the bottom path)
 * -    the **viewerMdle** somehow displays the result of the simulation
 * 
 * If this scenario is handled naively:
 * 
 * **sliderMdle** emit a new value -> **solverMdle** emit a new *solverModel* ->**combineMdle** emit a join with this newly created *solverModel* 
 * with the existing *physicalModel* -> **simulatorMdle** takes a couple of seconds to emit the simulation result -> 
 * **viewerMdle** display the results.
 * 
 * Our final user will be frustrated because he was expecting to get instant feedback on the result while 
 * aggressively moving the slider ðŸ¤¬.
 * 
 * This is unfortunate because the bottleneck in terms of performance of the computation relies only on the *physicalModel* 
 * and this one not only did not changed in terms of its content, but it is actually exactly the same object 
 * (same reference, the **combinerMdle** just used the *physicalModel* already available each time a new *solverModel*
 * was coming in). 
 * 
 * > ðŸ¤¯ Thanks to immutability, equality on references at different times guaranty that no properties
 * > of the object has been modified.
 * > It is very important for Flux and its 'functional' approach as it provides a straightforward way to safely (and immediately)
 * > retrieve existing intermediate results of computations from references, even for complex & large data-structures.
 * 
 * In the scenario depicted above, by caching the intermediate result against the reference of the *physicalModel*, 
 * the **simulatorMdle** can actually immediately retrieves the right intermediate result rather than having to 
 * redo the computations. This will makes our slider-aggressive user happy ðŸ¤© as the time consuming step of 
 * the computation has been removed and he can hopefully get a responsive experience while looking at the viewer. 
 * 
 * The nature of Flux applications, driven by events and with a common use of flow combination type of modules, 
 * end up of having such opportunities of (aggressive) optimizations actually quite often. 
 * It takes a bit more work for the developer to handle it, the Cache store has been designed
 * to facilitate this work.
 * 
 * ### Usage of the cache store in the modules
 * 
 * Let's try to implement a skeleton of the **simulatorMdle** of the above example:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * 
 * class PhysicalModel{...}
 * class SolverModel{...}
 * 
 * let contract = contract({
 *      description: 'expect to retrieve physical & solver models',
 *      requireds:{ 
 *          physModel: expectInstanceOf(PhysicalModel, ['physicalModel', 'physModel']),
 *          solverModel: expectInstanceOf(SolverModel, ['solverModel']) 
 *     }
 * })
 * export class Module extends ModuleFlux {
 *
 *      result$ : Pipe<number>
 *
 *       constructor( params ){
 *          super(params) 
 *
 *          this.addInput({
 *               contract,
 *               onTriggered: ({data, configuration, context}, {cache: Cache}) => 
 *                  this.simulate(data, context, cache)
 *           })
 *          this.result$ = this.addOutput()
 *      }
 * 
 *      simulate( 
 *          data: {physModel, solverModel}: {physModel: PhysicalModel, solverModel: SolverModel},
 *          context: Context,
 *          cache: Cache ) {
 *
 *          cache.getOrCreate$( 
 *              new ReferenceKey('physModel', physModel),
 *              () => this.longComputation(physModel)
 *          ).subscribe( (intermediateResult) => {
 *              let result = intermediateResult / fastComputation(solverModel) 
 *              this.result$.next({data:result,context})
 *              context.close()
 *          })
 *       }
 * 
 *      longComputation(physModel: PhysicalModel): Observable<number>{
 *          // a long and hard computation...
 *          return of(42).pipe(delay(2))
 *      }
 * 
 *      fastComputation(solverModel: SolverModel): number{
 *          // a fast computation...
 *          return 42
 *      }
 *  }
 * 
``` 
 * @module cache
